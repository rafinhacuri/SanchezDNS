üëâ Official guide: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

---

### üì¶ Step 2 ‚Äî Get the `docker-compose.yaml`
Choose one of the options below to download the configuration file:

<details>
<summary>üîΩ Using curl</summary>

```bash
curl -L -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafinhacuri/sanchezdns/main/docker-compose.yaml
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>üîΩ Using wget</summary>

```bash
wget -O docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafinhacuri/sanchezdns/main/docker-compose.yaml
```
</details>

Alternatively, copy it directly from the [example file](https://github.com/rafinhacuri/sanchezdns/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml).

---

### üìù Step 3 ‚Äî Configure Environment
Place your `.env` file in the project root directory. The following environment variables are required for proper operation:

```
SITE_URL="https://dns.example.com"
MONGO_URL="mongodb://mongo.example.com:27017"
MONGO_USERNAME="mongouser"
MONGO_PASSWORD="exp"
MONGO_DB_NAME="sanchezdns"
JWT_SECRET="exmp"
CRYPT_KEY="exp"
```

> **Note:**  
> - The `JWT_SECRET` must be **at least 32 characters long**.  
> - The `CRYPT_KEY` must be a **base64-encoded string that decodes to 32 bytes (AES‚Äë256)**.  
>   
> ‚úÖ To generate a valid encryption key run:
> 
> ```bash
> openssl rand -base64 32
> ```

---

### üöÄ Step 4 ‚Äî Launch Services
Run the following commands:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

The backend API and frontend UI are preconfigured and will start automatically via Docker.
