<details>
<summary>🔽 Using curl</summary>

```bash
curl -L -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafinhacuri/sanchezdns/main/docker-compose.yaml
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔽 Using wget</summary>

```bash

JWT_SECRET="exmp"
CRYPT_KEY="exp"
```

> **Note:**  
> - The `JWT_SECRET` must be **at least 32 characters long**.  
> - The `CRYPT_KEY` must be a **base64-encoded string that decodes to 32 bytes (AES‑256)**.  
>   
> ✅ To generate a valid encryption key run:
> 
> ```bash
> openssl rand -base64 32
> ```
