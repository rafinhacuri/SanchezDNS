# 🧾 Logs

The **Logs** page in **SanchezDNS** provides a complete audit trail of actions performed within the selected DNS connection.

## 🔍 Overview
Logs record every significant action taken by users on a specific DNS connection, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Each entry includes:
- **Username** — who performed the action  
- **Action** — what was done (e.g., created a zone, added a record)  
- **Details** — additional information about the event  
- **Timestamp** — when the action occurred  

## ⚙️ Behavior
- Logs are automatically generated for all changes made through the system.  
- They are **connection‑specific**, meaning you only see logs related to the currently selected DNS server.  
- Data is displayed in real time and stored securely in MongoDB for persistence.  

## 🔒 Access Control
Only **administrators** can access the Logs page. Regular users cannot view or modify logs.

This feature ensures you can always trace what happened, who did it, and when — keeping your DNS operations auditable and secure.
